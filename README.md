# SQLDataAnalysis

This code shows queries made to a regional database. Three different mini-projects are displayed in this repository with their respective folders. In each folder you will find the .csv(Comma Separated Values) file(s), the database file, and the text file(s) holding my queries. Data is downloaded from public resources and is manipulated with different purposes in mind. The three projects are listed below with a short description.

Note: I have not included the results of my queries simply because the database files are large and multiple queries are done. If you would like to see the result of a query or understand why i made a certain choice feel free to contact me at zayd.alameddine@gmail.com or open the files and run the program on your own computer
